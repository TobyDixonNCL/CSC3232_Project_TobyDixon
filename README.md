# CSC3232 Coursework - Toby Dixon

## How to play:
- Load the Unity Project and locate the main menu scene (Assets/GameScenes/MainMenu).
- Press play and the game will run!

## Issues:
- Currently, the system that tracks enemy states between scenes only works when running the game in the engine. Building the project for some reason breaks this feature.
